# MobWeb_MassResetCustomerPasswords extension for Magento

A simple extension that adds a new link "Send new passwords" to the customer mass actions in the admin panel. The selected customers will be sent a new password using Magento's default "New Password" email.

This is useful if you have imported customer accounts from an external source and need to assign them all a custom password and notify them about it.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
