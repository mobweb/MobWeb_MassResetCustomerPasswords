# MobWeb_MassResetCustomerPasswords extension for Magento

A simple extension that adds a new link "Send new passwords" to the customer mass actions in the admin panel. The selected customers will be sent a new password using Magento's default "New Password" email.

This is useful if you have imported customer accounts from an external source and need to assign them all a custom password and notify them about it.

##Â Shell scripts

There are two shell scripts included:

- mass-reset-customer-passwords.php allows to batch process customer accounts and assign and send the passwords for a limited amount of accounts. This makes it a bit easier to process a big amount of accounts.

- reset-and-export-customer-passwords.php allows to reset the passwords of all customer accounts and export the account data (gender, first name, last name, email, new password) as a CSV file. This can then be used to send this information to the customers using an external email service (e.g. Mailchimp).

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
